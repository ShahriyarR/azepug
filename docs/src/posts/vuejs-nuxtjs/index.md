## Building simple E-Commerce with NuxtJS and FastAPI (SERIES)

Our project will be based on this wonderful [Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg5zkd9nm6w) by [Code With Stein](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfVoYvY8BfTDeF63JQmQJvg)

But we are using NuxtJS instead of VueJS and FastAPI instead off Django/DRF.
